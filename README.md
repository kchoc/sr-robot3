# sr-robot3 Experimental Fork

This repository is an experimental fork of the `sr-robot3` library. It introduces support for the accelerometer and compass within the simulator environment.

## Purpose

The goal of this fork is to extend the functionality of the `sr-robot3` library by enabling the use of additional sensors in simulation. This enhancement allows for more comprehensive testing and development without requiring physical hardware.
