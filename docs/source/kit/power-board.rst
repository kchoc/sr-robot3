Power Board
===========

The Power Board distributes power from the battery to the rest of the
kit. It provides six individual general-purpose 12V power outputs along
with a separate power connector for the Raspberry Pi.

It also holds the internal On | Off switch for the whole robot as well as
the Start button which is used to start your robot code.

Connectors
----------

There are six power output connectors on the board, labelled L0–L3, H0,
and H1. These can supply around 11.1V (±15%). The “H” connectors will
supply more current than the “L” connectors.

They should be used to connect to the motor board power input, though
can also be used to power other devices. These are enabled when your
robot code is started and can also be turned on or off from your code.

There are two 5V connectors that can be used to connect low-current
devices that take 5V inputs, such as the Raspberry Pi.

There is also a Micro USB B connector which should be used to connect
the Raspberry Pi for control of the power board.

Finally, there are connectors for external Start and On|Off switches.
You may connect any latching switch for the On|Off switch, or a
push-to-make button for the Start button.

.. Hint:: If you intend to use only the internal On|Off
    switch, a CamCon must be plugged into the On|Off connector with a wire
    connecting one pin to the other pin on the same connector. Your power
    board should already have one of these plugged in.

| H0-1,   | Green when the corresponding output is on. Red      | Off      |

+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+----------+

|         | booting                                             |          |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------+----------+

On power-up, the Power Board will emit some beeps, which are related to
the version of the firmware it has installed.

If the Power Board starts beeping (and all the outputs turn off) then
this means that the whole board's current limit has been triggered.

Controls

| Control| Use                                                           |

+========+===============================================================+
| ON|OFF | Turns the power board on, when used in conjunction with an    |
|        | external switch or jumper wire                                |

Case dimensions
---------------

The case measures 83x99x24mm. Don't forget that the cables will stick
out.

Designs
-------

You can access the schematics and source code of the firmware for the
power board in the following places. You do not need this information to
use the board but it may be of interest to some people.

   If overall current limit is exceeded, the Power Board will turn off
   and start beeping.
